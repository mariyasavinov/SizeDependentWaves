# SizeDependentWaves
This directory contains MATLAB code to compute numerical solutions to the 1D, 2D, and discrete models found in  the paper:
Krishna et al. "Size-dependent transition from steady contraction to waves in actomyosin networks with turnover," Nat. Phys 2023 (in press).

For the 1D and 2D models, the {\tt testfile} scripts are used to set parameters, call the {\tt solver}, and then save the generated data and sample kymograph into either a {\tt simulations_1D} or {\tt simulations 2D} directory.

For questions on these scripts, contact the repository owner at mas10009@nyu.edu
